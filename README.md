Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 31-year-old developer from Brabant, The Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. I've been dabbling in tech from the early 2004's on, and
since then, I learned an incredible amount about software engineering, architecture, and infrastructure.

Most of the time, I work on PHP projects using Symfony components or frameworks like Symfony or Laravel. On occasion,
I'll divert to languages like JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, and Go as the need arises.

I've been freelancing since 2012, and I had the opportunity to work with many great clients such as the Dutch
government, Nike, Sanoma Media, and [many more](https://jorijn.com/projects-and-references/).

When I'm not coding, I'm probably out with friends, running, or perfecting my addiction
to [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga).

Want to collaborate on something cool with me? [Find me here](https://jorijn.com/contact/).
